                            We start off with a map illustrating the number of depression cases per country. From first sight it is apparent, that almost all countries have depression cases in the millions. The notable countries that are worst hit are USA, Brazil, Ukraine and Russia.
                            A bleak picture indeed !!

                            Academic strain is nothing new. The radial chart shows that undergraduate students and fresh graduates take the brunt of depression in the academic world. This is insightful since it correlates with the fact that undergraduate students need to deal with
                            deadlines and exam stress. On the flip side, fresh graduates struggle to find dignified jobs. Both phenomenon are widely discussed and this visualisation further proves the point.

                            Regular internet access is the main culprits in most depression cases. This is not surprising since the modern human spends an immense amount of time on social media platforms which are often attributed to anxiety, mood swings, lack of concentration,
                            tiredness and obsessive thinking all of which follow suit.

                            This chart is very interesting as it shows there is no correlation between expenses and children which is often cited as a reason in the mainstream media. Individuals with zero or more are spread on the expenses column signifying no solid relation between
                            the two. Rather it a significant number of depression cases are more concentrated at individuals with low value assets signified by the high density of lines in the lowest asset region.

                            This chart is also interesting as it tells a story from a different angle. Even if men are more depressed in general as seen on the left, women tend to have a higer suicide count.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another insight is that young and grown adults make up for most of the cases. This is alarming since it shows the current and future workforce don't possess a healthy mind - a crucial element to keep the economic wheel spinning.

                            All is not lost!! We look at the top 5 most happiest nations on the planet and filter some common traits that make them as such. First off is GDP Per Capita üí∞, which is high among all the 5 nations, indicating the requirement that a significant portion
                            of the population must contribute to the economy.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At second place comes social support ü§ùüèª, that is body of governance on which a population can rely on.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Next up is life expectancy üß¨ and freedom to make life choices ‚úä. Both of these are at a tie on the chart and compliment one another. It is no surprise that if a population can live longer, they have the opportunity to do explore and do more.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The first three may not be possible for all countries, but that's not all. Next up is generosity üëç. This does not require any money or resources - all it takes is kindness and the impact can be exponentially beneficial.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally we have perceived corruption üìõ, which needs to be kept in check to ensure a happier society
